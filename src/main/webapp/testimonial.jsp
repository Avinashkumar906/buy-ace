          <blockquote>I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism
            and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that
            unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.

          <blockquote> Peace is not a relationship of nations. It is a condition of mind brought about by a serenity of
            soul. Peace is not merely the absence of war. It is also a state of mind. Lasting peace can come only to
            peaceful people.

          <blockquote> Forgiveness is not always easy. At times, it feels more painful than the wound we suffered, to
            forgive the one that inflicted it. And yet, there is no peace without forgiveness.

          <blockquote>Of all our dreams today there is none more important - or so hard to realise - than that of peace
            in the world. May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert
            it one day into reality. </blockquote>
